                  <h3>1. Initial Consultation</h3>
                  <h4>We begin with the client. If we haven’t previously worked with the organization or department with the vacancy, we arrange an in-person meeting to get to know them. The goal is to gather a thorough understanding of the company and the specific role. This meeting typically involves both the HR manager and the hiring manager, allowing us to get a clear picture of the required skills, company culture, and ideal candidate profile.</h4>

These profiles, once approved by the client, serve as the foundation for informing and engaging potential candidates. We ensure transparent communication throughout the entire process, providing regular updates and feedback to both the client and candidates for a smooth progression.</h4>
